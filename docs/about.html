  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="../images/profilepicture.jpg" class="profileimage">
  <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Arts in Korean and a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics in 2018. 
    I also graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2021. 
    Prior to graduation, I was working as a Teaching Assistant for CS 340, the Introduction to Databases Course. 
    In that course, the students are tasked with developing a project website from start to finish. 
    This involves developing a project plan, creating a schema, providing CRUD functionalities, and ending with a completed website.
    I assisted with grading the project steps and providing feedback to help their projects progress smoothly. 
    <br> <br> I occasionally watch anime and enjoy listening to kpop. I also love learning different languages. 
    In my spare time, I sometimes play rhythm games, watch twitch streams, or draw. 
    Depending on the season, I like going skiing or scuba diving.
