  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="../images/profilepicture.jpg" class="profileimage">
  <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Arts in Korean and a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics in 2018. 
    I also graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2021. 
    <br> <br>
    Prior to graduation, I was working as a teaching assistant for the introduction to databases course. 
    In the course, the students are tasked with developing a project website from start to finish. 
    This involves developing a project plan, creating a schema, providing CRUD functionalities, and ending with a completed website.
    I assisted with grading the project steps (1 - 7) and providing feedback to help their projects progress smoothly. 
    This ranged from troubleshooting their code, checking their entity relationships were feasible, providing tips for database connectivity, helping teams rework
    their project if they had proposed too complicated of a project, and providing resources so the students could be better equipped to complete their project 
    (depending on if they were utilizing node.js or flask).
    <br> <br> I occasionally watch anime and enjoy listening to kpop. I also love learning different languages. 
    In my spare time, I sometimes play rhythm games, watch twitch streams, or draw. 
    Depending on the season, I like going skiing or scuba diving.
