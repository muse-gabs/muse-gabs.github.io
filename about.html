      <h2>Story behind the website</h2>
      <div>
         In a joint decision with my boyfriend, we split 50/50 and purchased an E30 BMW in March of 2018 and have been learning the 
         inner workings of the car. This ranges from changing the gears in the odometer to changing out the power steering belt, 
         AC belt, alternator belt, and timing belt, changing out the spark plugs, doing a full fluid flush, and learning how to 
         drive a manual car. It's been an adventure. This website that I've created is for a final project as part of Oregon 
         State University's CS 290 course and also my first foray into building a website. I have been enjoying my time in this 
         program and wanted to be able to showcase my hobby as well as what I've learned. The requirements were an unordered html list, 
         a picture carousel, links to a separate page, a link to a downloadable file, and a form submit. I had some help with getting the
         form submit to a google spreadsheet via davidmccoy's https://medium.com/@dmccoy/how-to-submit-an-html-form-to-google-sheets-without-google-forms-b833952cc175
         tutorial on how to submit a html form to google sheets without google sheets, with some minor changes, and also showing that the 
         response was recorded afterwards. This was also the first time I had delved into using jquery, which was surprisingly fun, albeit the syntax
         was difficult to get started on.
