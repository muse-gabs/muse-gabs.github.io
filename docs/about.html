  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="../images/profilepicture.jpg" class="profileimage">
  <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Arts in Korean and a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics. I am currently in Oregon State University's post-baccalaureate program and expected to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in June 2021. I am currently working part-time as a teaching assistant for Oregon State University's introduction to databases course. The students are tasked with developing a project website from start to finish. This involves developing a project plan, creating a schema, providing CRUD functionalities, and ending with a completed website. I assist with grading the project steps and providing feedback to help their projects progress smoothly. <br> <br> I occasionally watch anime and enjoy listening to kpop. I also love learning different languages. In my spare time, I sometimes play rhythm games, watch twitch streams, or draw. Depending on the season, I like going skiing or scuba diving. <br> <br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielle-pang-a63748158/">Connect on LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/musegabs/">Follow on Instagram</a> </p>
