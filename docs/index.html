  <p>Welcome to my website! This website used to be solely about the car but as of 2/7/2021 
    it has been updated to give a look into the different interests that I've been pursuing. 
    For information about my coding work, please click the icon: <a href="https://github.com/muse-gabs"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>. 
    This is a personal website that was created using css, javascript and html for computer and mobile devices. 
    <br> <br>
    As part of my final capstone project, my team and I created an AI car identification application as a proof of concept.
    For the code base that we used, please click the icon: <a href="https://github.com/carzamm/carzam"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>.
    To visit the application <a href="https://carzamm.herokuapp.com/">click here</a>.
    <br> <br>
    Another project that I worked on was a musician matching application, a musician creates a profile and can create advertisements for a gig in the area. 
    They can then search for people who have made their profile public that match the criteria. Once matched, their information is shared and they can get in
    contact for the gig that was advertised. For the code base that we used, please click the icon: <a href="https://github.com/monetholt/quaver-n-bits"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>.

    <br> <br> Below is a clip of my coding that I did for a flutter application project as part of my Mobile Development Course. 
    This application was required to have a predictor, a resume, and a business card and be able to be in portrait and landscape mode without any text overflow. </p>
