      When thinking about the BMW car, you often hear the terms "beamer," "beemer," and "bimmer", when discussing the automobile, the correct term
      is "bimmer" or "beemer", "beamer" solely refers to the BMW motorcycle. "Beamer" comes from Great Britain and was used to distinguish it from 
      the British manufacturer "Beezer". The nickname "bimmer" originated in the 1970s, when BMW automobiles became popular in the US. It wasn't until 
      the Boston Chapter magazine for BMW fans was published did "bimmer" win out the other nicknames and has now become the term for BMW automobiles all
      over the world.
