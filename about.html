      <h2>About the creator of this page</h2>
      <div>
         I purchased an E30 BMW in March of 2018 and have been learning the inner workings of the car, from changing the gears in the
         odometer to changing out the power steering belt, AC belt, alternator belt, and timing belt, changing out the spark plugs, 
         doing a full fluid flush, and learning how to drive a manual car. It's been an adventure. This website that I've created is 
         for a final project as part of Oregon State University's CS 290 course and also my first foray into building a website. I
         have been enjoying my time in this program and wanted to be able to showcase my hobby as well as what I've learned.
